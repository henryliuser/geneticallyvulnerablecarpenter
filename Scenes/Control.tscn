text = "The year is 2019. You are in the North Pole. That is because you are Santa Claus. Usually, you would be heartily ho ho hoing and stuff, but recently, you have acquired an illness. This would be tragic for most people. However, you are not most people. You are Santa Claus. Through your preliminary investigations, you have determined that the cause of your illness is cursed christmas beings breaking important machines in your intestines. For most people, this would cause despair, because for most people, this is an incurable condition. Cursed christmas beings are notoriously hard to get rid of after all, and important intestine machines are notoriously hard to fix. But lucky for you, you are santa claus, and you have a miniature santa carpenter to enter your intestines and fix your machines for you. In order to  get your body to accept your santa carpenter and not hurl it out of your intestines, you imbued it with your dna and gave it life. This allowed your carpenter to enter your body, but it had an unintended side effect: now the cursed christmas beings harm your carpenter as well, and every time a machine breaks, he finds it more difficult to move. Armed with only his wrench, your carpenter must fix your machines and stop you from dying forever.
